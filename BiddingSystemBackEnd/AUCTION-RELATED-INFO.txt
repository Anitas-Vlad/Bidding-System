TODO Ascending Bids:

    In a standard auction, participants typically place bids that are equal to or higher than the 
current highest bid.
    The bid amount represents the amount a bidder is willing to pay for the item.


TODO Minimum Bid Increment
    
    To ensure a fair and transparent bidding process, online auction platforms often set 
a minimum bid increment.
    Bidders must place bids that exceed the current highest bid by at least the minimum
bid increment.


TODO Proxy Bidding:
    
    Some auction platforms use a proxy bidding system. In this system, a bidder can enter the maximum amount they are willing to pay for an item.
The system automatically increases the bid on behalf of the bidder in predefined increments, up to the maximum amount specified.


TODO Reserve Price:
    
    A reserve price is the minimum amount a seller is willing to accept for an item.
If the highest bid does not meet or exceed the reserve price, the item may not be sold.


TODO Buyer's Premium:
    
    In some auctions, a buyer's premium is added to the final bid amount. 
This is an additional percentage of the final bid that the winning bidder must pay.
