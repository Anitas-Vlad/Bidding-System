TODO : 
    * Users have : amount of money in account. They can add more if needed.
        ===> You can only bid for something you can afford.
    * Add a property for Bidding : Bidding.IsActive. This way you can create a bidding and TODO Snipe.
    * Create class UserValidator (IsEmailValid / IsPasswordValid / etc...)
    * Refactor : StartingPrice should be on Auction, not on Item.
    * Implement the Notifications functionality.
    * TODO : Look into the Observer pattern for notifications implementation refactoring. Maybe Hangfire -> SendNotification
    
    * The seller is taxed a percentage by the AuctionWebsite and goes into the Website's Account WHICH SHOULD BE AN ADMIN USER.

MUST : 
* Authorisation 
* As an auction is created and constantly exists until the chosen time comes, the Api is constantly active too.
Create a method "EndAuction()" that when creating an auction, sets an amount of time to wait until in triggers and chooses the winner.  

DONE : 
    * appsettings.json stuff.
    * Users : Login, Register
    * Add ItemService where you handle changes related to Items.
    * In BiddingService Validate : CreateBidding :
    * Find out why and fix PlaceBidding
    * Cancel Bidding.
    * Minimum Bid Increment
    * When placing another bidding, you check the user's money and the previous bidding amount if it's enough. 
CheckIfHasEnough(amount){return amount<previousBidding+Added(IF THE USER HAS ENOUGH TO BID MORE.)}
    * Freeze money so the user can't use too much.
    * NeededAmount = NewAmount - OldAmount ===> Money MUST= NeededAmount => Bidding.amount += NeededAmount 
    * Create Migration
    * Unfreeze User.Credit when canceling a bidding.
    * refactored auction.IsBidAmountValid();
    * In Auction.RemoveBid(), First check if the bid to be removed is the highest one.
Maybe you don't even need to use Auction.SetNewHighestBid();.
    * Users Must have Items in order to be able to sell them. AddItem(), RemoveItem(), SellItem(), etc...
    * Every Auction has a CreatorUser. I need in in order to Earn the money after selling items;
    * Handle Winning Bid.
    * Handle Losing Bid.
    * Enum for BidStatus.
    * Change the times to UTC. Maybe for developing, change the EndTime for creating auctions to be fixed +minutes.
    * User should have a List<Notification> and be updated whenever something happens. like WINNING or LOSING!!!
TODO * Look into these topics for EndAuction(): Background Task or Timer / use a library like Hangfire or Quartz.NET to schedule a job

    * Users can create Auctions. 
    * When an auction closes and there is a winner, The FrozenCredit goes into the Account of the seller.
