TODO : 
    * TODO : Look into the Observer pattern for notifications implementation refactoring. Maybe Hangfire -> SendNotification

    TODO : ### IMPORTANT ### :    Don't give too much info in the error message : "Email Not Found." or "Invalid Password.". 

TODO - NICE TO HAVE : 
    
    * Set notifications to Seen. Check if it is optimal to do it through an endpoint that accepts a List<Id> that would 
be sent from the FrontEnd.
    * Add interests to users so that when an auction for an item related to their interests is created, the users are notified

TODO - MUST : 

    * AdminsController
    * In the UsersController, create a SearchUserProfileById() that does not show too much information, such as Credit/FrozenCredit
? --- Check into AuctionService.SetBiddingStatus(). Is it really needed?
    * Use the BidStatus.Cancelled Enum instead of removing it from the database for a better user history.
    * Notification for winner, Total amount paid must include the taxes.

TODO - DONE :
 
    * appSettings.json stuff.
    * Users : Login, Register
    * Add ItemService where you handle changes related to Items.
    * In BiddingService Validate : CreateBidding :
    * Find out why and fix PlaceBidding
    * Cancel Bidding.
    * Minimum Bid Increment
    * When placing another bidding, you check the user's money and the previous bidding amount if it's enough. 
CheckIfHasEnough(amount){return amount<previousBidding+Added(IF THE USER HAS ENOUGH TO BID MORE.)}

    * Freeze money so the user can't use too much.
    * NeededAmount = NewAmount - OldAmount ===> Money MUST= NeededAmount => Bidding.amount += NeededAmount 
    * Create Migration
    * Unfreeze User.Credit when canceling a bidding.
    * refactored auction.IsBidAmountValid();
    * In Auction.RemoveBid(), First check if the bid to be removed is the highest one.
Maybe you don't even need to use Auction.SetNewHighestBid();.

    * Users Must have Items in order to be able to sell them. AddItem(), RemoveItem(), SellItem(), etc...
    * Every Auction has a CreatorUser. I need in in order to Earn the money after selling items;
    * Handle Winning Bid.
    * Handle Losing Bid.
    * Enum for BidStatus.
    * Change the times to UTC. Maybe for developing, change the EndTime for creating auctions to be fixed +minutes.
    * User should have a List<Notification> and be updated whenever something happens. like WINNING or LOSING!!!
    * Look into these topics for EndAuction(): Background Task or Timer / use a library like Hangfire or Quartz.NET to schedule a job

    * Users can create Auctions. 
    * When an auction closes and there is a winner, The FrozenCredit goes into the Account of the seller.
    * Refactor : StartingPrice should be on Auction, not on Item.
    * Users have : amount of money in account. They can add more if needed.
        ===> You can only bid for something you can afford.
    * Check if I have to use the claims or I can leave it like this.

    * Authorisation
    * As an auction is created and constantly exists until the chosen time comes, the Api is constantly active too.
    * Create a method "EndAuction()" that when creating an auction, sets an amount of time to wait until in triggers and chooses the winner.
    * Write Controller/Endpoint Verify Notifications
    
    * Actively change the Auction.WinningBidId on PlaceBid.
    * Actively change the Auction.WinningBidId on CancelBid.
    In AuctionService.EndAuction() : Check for the errors that made me write the HandleLosingBids in NoWinningBidCase 
and delete the List<Bids> losingBids.
    * Implement the Notifications functionality.
    * Send notifications to all: winners / losers / sellers with details related to their actions.
    * Make the admin user and the logics between tax and the seller.
    * The seller is taxed a percentage by the AuctionWebsite and goes into the Website's Account WHICH SHOULD BE AN ADMIN USER.
    * for some reason, User got a notification that they paid 150, but the bet was 180. CHECK WHY!
    * Notification to Owner for successfully ended auction.
    * Add User.Auctions as a List<Auction> for a seller needs access to an auction
    * Notification for the owner(aka boss of the website) that an auction has ended successfully and the tax they received from the seller.
